## Main Task

### 1. Optimizing Concentration.py code
#### Task Detail 
- ODE solving part has been removed to make the calculation faster.
    - Can we just simply use the decay function for the activity?
    - This solved ODE in the calculation is function of time and local concentration. 
    - That being said, the activation is only one direction. Always being activated and more activated. 

- stateVariable: How the coefficient is being determined based on the degree of local concentration will cause the problem in future for sure. 

```python
def calcStateVariable(numberOfCells,
                      time,
                      ConcbyCell,
                      stateVariable):
    
    #t = scipy.linspace(timeb,time,repeat)
    newstateVar = []
    stateDepFactor = []
       
    for n in np.arange(numberOfCells):
        
        # This is exponential function that is fitted to the exponential function 
        if ConcbyCell[n] > 1:
            coefficient = (1-1/ConcbyCell[n])
        elif ConcbyCell[n] > 0.9 - 1e-14 and ConcbyCell[n] < 1 + 1e-14:
            coefficient = 0.5
        elif ConcbyCell[n] > 0.8 - 1e-14 and ConcbyCell[n] < 0.9 + 1e-14:
            coefficient = 0.45
        elif ConcbyCell[n] > 0.7 - 1e-14 and ConcbyCell[n] < 0.8 + 1e-14:
            coefficient = 0.4
        elif ConcbyCell[n] > 0.5 - 1e-14 and ConcbyCell[n] < 0.7 + 1e-14:
            coefficient = 0.35
        elif ConcbyCell[n] > 0.2 - 1e-14 and ConcbyCell[n] < 0.5 + 1e-14:
            coefficient = 0.3
        else:
            coefficient = ConcbyCell[n]
            
        Var = coefficient*np.exp(-0.001*time-0.001*ConcbyCell[n]*time) + 0.001/(0.001 + 0.001*ConcbyCell[n])
        #print(ConcbyCell[n])
        newstateVar.append(Var)
        state = 1/(1+(0.2/Var)**5)
        stateDepFactor.append(state)
        
    return newstateVar, stateDepFactor
```
