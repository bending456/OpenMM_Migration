## Main Task

### 1. What was the major task #1
#### Task Detail 
- So far, I do not see decent migration of cells based on the gradient of substances in the background 
- I personally think the collision of cells is a big big problem 
- To solve it, I may need to reconsider the temperature condition. 
- DispScale = 300 : This results in quite reasonable outcome
- Enlarged the magnitude of undirected motion by 5 fold 
- Reduced DispScale down to 200
- Need to test steady case
