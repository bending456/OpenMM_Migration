# Introduction
This tutorial will guide users from the installation of [OpenMM package](http://openmm.org/) and the customized pacakge written by [Yevhen](mailto:yevhen.cherniavskyi@ucalgary.ca), called FeedInForce (Special Thank To Yevhen!!) to the OpenMM based cell migration. 

## What are we trying to simulate via this script? 
### About this project 
We are specifically trying to simulate the migration of microglial cells as the chemoattractant is present their surroundings. 
Therefore, this calculation contains:
- Estimation of chemoattractant diffusion 
- Simulation of migration based on the gradient of chemoattractant concentration.
